# global 820

Got tired of all those leechers, spamming the chat with all of their challenges they'd like to get invited to? Is the ignore list just not long enough?

Then filter your chat with this external program. (A second monitor is highly recommended)

pretty checklist, because everyone else has one: 
  - filters the chat through regular expressions
  - use your own filter (for example, only show specific masters)
  - click on a message to copy a party request whisper to your clipboard
  - open source (because who trusts random 3rd party tools on the internet?)
